# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Our friend Louise wants to know the campaign outcomes of plays based on each play's launch date and funding goals. Using the Kickstarter dataset we were able to create charts to easily understand a play's campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges
To examine theater outcomes by launch date the successful, failed, and canceled plays are charted by months of the year. To examine theater outcomes by goals the percentage successful, failed, and canceled plays are charted by a breakdown of dollar-amount ranges.

Except for that no plays were canceled, no challenges are present.

## Results

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
May, June, and July had the highest successful outcomes based on launch date. Of the 1369 outcomes, 839 were successful, 493 failed, and 37 were canceled.  

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Goals of less than $1000 have the highest percent successful rate. Goals in the range of $45,000 to $49,999 had a 100% failed rate.

### Limitations of this dataset?
While we know the category and subcategory the genre is not easily identifiable. While one can glean the genre of the entertainment by the title and the blurb, a genre filter is not readily available. If Louise wants to look further into what make the successful campaigns successful, I would recommend looking at the genre of the to understand the topics backers are most interested in.

### Other possible tables and/or graphs to create?
To further examine outcomes with the highest success rate, we could chart the launch date in comparison with the deadline date. This charting would allow Louise to know the best weeks in the month to launch campaigns.
